## Description
The idea for this project is for the user to input a word and see some information about the word 
such as definition, frequency of use, synonyms, etc. The practical value of this project varies 
from getting a simple definition of a word to finding other words that rhymes with the word
originally entered. It is possible to, for example, enter the word "facetious" in order to find out
the definition and frequency of usage of the word and use said word to impress your collegues. To
make the projeect more fun, we decided to add a feature that searches for famous quotes related to
the user's input.


### Goals
- When a user enters a word, a set of facts should be displayed on the screen as well as the word
entered as well as the famous quotes containing the word. The facts in this case are definition,

synonyms, syllables, and pronunciation.

synonyms, and pronunciation.


- When a word is entered, it can be saved and referenced in the future.

- When a prevously entered word is selected, the facts related to that word should be available to
the user.

- When the famous quotes are displayed to the screen, a limit of 5 quotes should be on the page.

- When the page is refreshed, the previously entered words are visible to the user.
